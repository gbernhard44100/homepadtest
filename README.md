## About HomepadTest
It is a REST API I have prepared to show my skills using the framework Laravel 7.19.0 and PHP7.4.

## It is recommended you use the VM Homestead to develop your project with Laravel
1- Install Vagrant on your computer
2- Install Virtualbox on your computer
3- Clone the Homestead repository : git clone https://github.com/laravel/homestead.git ~/Homestead
4- Go inside the repository you have cloned (cd ~/Homestead) and launch "bash init.sh" to create the Homestead.yaml
5- Create a repository where you will store the application
6- Fill the Homestead.yaml file to configure your vagrant VM
7- Generate the SSH key by launching the command "ssh-keygen -t rsa" and fill the information
8- Go to the clone repository and launch to command : vagrant up

The necessary box will be downloaded and your VM vagrant will be set on.

-To acces the VM via SSH use the command vagrant ssh
-To stop the VM use the command vagrant halt
-To reload the VM use the command vagrant reload --provision
